# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project is a machine learning solution for predicting loan approval statuses using Python. It leverages a dataset containing applicant details, including credit history, income, and loan amount, to train predictive models. The project applies data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering techniques, followed by model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Performance metrics such as accuracy and precision are used to evaluate each model, helping identify the best approach for reliable loan approval predictions.
